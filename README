This module intercepts all writes to STDOUT and lets you frobnicate
the data with your own functions.

To install, do the usual dance:
    less Makefile.PL
    less lib/Tie/Hash/Longest.pm
    less t/*
those being to ensure that I'm not being evil.  Pay particular attention
to t/01_defaults.t, as that generates code and executes it using system().
The fact that I can do this while you install a module demonstrates why
you really need to pay attention to what's going on.  I could just as
easily do something horrible like trash your home directory.

then do this to install the module:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install (you may need to do this as root)
